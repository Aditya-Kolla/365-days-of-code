1.Ayoub and Lost Array
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1105/C

Ayoub had an array a of integers of size n

and this array had two interesting properties:

    All the integers in the array were between l

and r
(inclusive).
The sum of all the elements was divisible by 3

    . 

Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array n
and the numbers l and r

, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array.

Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 109+7
(i.e. the remainder when dividing by 109+7). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print 0

.
Input

The first and only line contains three integers n
, l and r (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤l≤r≤109

) — the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.
Output

Print the remainder when dividing by 109+7
the number of ways to restore the array.
