1.Kefa and First Steps
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/A

Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) he makes ai money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence ai. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!
Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n integers a1,  a2,  ...,  an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
Output

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.

2.Maximum Increase
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/702/A

You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.
Input

The first line contains single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
Output

Print the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

3.QAQ
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/894/A

"QAQ" is a word to denote an expression of crying. Imagine "Q" as eyes with tears and "A" as a mouth.

Now Diamond has given Bort a string consisting of only uppercase English letters of length n. There is a great number of "QAQ" in the string (Diamond is so cute!).
Bort wants to know how many subsequences "QAQ" are in the string Diamond has given. Note that the letters "QAQ" don't have to be consecutive, but the order of letters should be exact.
Input

The only line contains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). It's guaranteed that the string only contains uppercase English letters.
Output

Print a single integer — the number of subsequences "QAQ" in the string.
