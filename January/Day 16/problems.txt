1.Mishka and the Last Exam
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1093/C

Mishka is trying really hard to avoid being kicked out of the university. In particular, he was doing absolutely nothing for the whole semester, miraculously passed some exams so that just one is left.

There were n
classes of that subject during the semester and on i-th class professor mentioned some non-negative integer ai

to the students. It turned out, the exam was to tell the whole sequence back to the professor.

Sounds easy enough for those who attended every class, doesn't it?

Obviously Mishka didn't attend any classes. However, professor left some clues on the values of a

to help out students like Mishka:

    a

was sorted in non-decreasing order (a1≤a2≤⋯≤an
);
n
was even;
the following sequence b
, consisting of n2 elements, was formed and given out to students: bi=ai+an−i+1

    . 

Professor also mentioned that any sequence a
, which produces sequence b

with the presented technique, will be acceptable.

Help Mishka to pass that last exam. Restore any sorted sequence a
of non-negative integers, which produces sequence b with the presented technique. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct sequence a, which produces the given sequence b

.
Input

The first line contains a single integer n
(2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of sequence a. n

is always even.

The second line contains n2
integers b1,b2,…,bn2 (0≤bi≤1018) — sequence b, where bi=ai+an−i+1

.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct sequence a
, which produces the given sequence b

.
Output

Print n
integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1018

) in a single line.

a1≤a2≤⋯≤an

should be satisfied.

bi=ai+an−i+1
should be satisfied for all valid i.

2.Doors Breaking and Repairing

output
standard output

You are policeman and you are playing a game with Slavik. The game is turn-based and each turn consists of two phases. During the first phase you make your move and during the second phase Slavik makes his move.

There are n
doors, the i-th door initially has durability equal to ai

.

During your move you can try to break one of the doors. If you choose door i
and its current durability is bi then you reduce its durability to max(0,bi−x) (the value x

is given).

During Slavik's move he tries to repair one of the doors. If he chooses door i
and its current durability is bi then he increases its durability to bi+y (the value y is given). Slavik cannot repair doors with current durability equal to 0

.

The game lasts 10100

turns. If some player cannot make his move then he has to skip it.

Your goal is to maximize the number of doors with durability equal to 0

at the end of the game. You can assume that Slavik wants to minimize the number of such doors. What is the number of such doors in the end if you both play optimally?
Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n
, x and y (1≤n≤100, 1≤x,y≤105) — the number of doors, value x and value y

, respectively.

The second line of the input contains n
integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤105), where ai is the initial durability of the i

-th door.
Output

Print one integer — the number of doors with durability equal to 0
at the end of the game, if you and Slavik both play optimally.
