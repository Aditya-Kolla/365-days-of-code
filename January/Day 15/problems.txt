Integer Sequence Dividing
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1102/A

You are given an integer sequence 1,2,…,n. You have to divide it into two sets A and B in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and |sum(A)−sum(B)| is minimum possible.

The value |x| is the absolute value of x and sum(S) is the sum of elements of the set S.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅109).

Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible value of |sum(A)−sum(B)| if you divide the initial sequence 1,2,…,n into two sets A and B.
