1. Supermarket
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/919/A

We often go to supermarkets to buy some fruits or vegetables, and on the tag there prints the price for a kilo. But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that a yuan for b kilos (You don't need to care about what "yuan" is), the same as a/b yuan for a kilo.

Now imagine you'd like to buy m kilos of apples. You've asked n supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.

You can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.

Input
The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1≤n≤5000, 1≤m≤100), denoting that there are n supermarkets and you want to buy m kilos of apples.

The following n lines describe the information of the supermarkets. Each line contains two positive integers a,b (1≤a,b≤100), denoting that in this supermarket, you are supposed to pay a yuan for b kilos of apples.

Output
The only line, denoting the minimum cost for m kilos of apples. Please make sure that the absolute or relative error between your answer and the correct answer won't exceed 10−6.

Formally, let your answer be x, and the jury's answer be y. Your answer is considered correct if |x−y|max(1,|y|)≤10−6.

2. Hungry Student Problem
http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/903/A

Ivan's classes at the university have just finished, and now he wants to go to the local CFK cafe and eat some fried chicken.

CFK sells chicken chunks in small and large portions. A small portion contains 3 chunks; a large one — 7 chunks. Ivan wants to eat exactly x chunks. Now he wonders whether he can buy exactly this amount of chicken.

Formally, Ivan wants to know if he can choose two non-negative integers a and b in such a way that a small portions and b large ones contain exactly x chunks.

Help Ivan to answer this question for several values of x!

Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of testcases.

The i-th of the following n lines contains one integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) — the number of chicken chunks Ivan wants to eat.

Output
Print n lines, in i-th line output YES if Ivan can buy exactly xi chunks. Otherwise, print NO.
